# Static Files and Theme Installation

- So, far now when we have covered the basic main stuff, we can make our website look a bit better. Cause all the previous looks honestly sucks. So, it's now time to configure our static files  with our django  project, so static files are basically any kind of css, javascript or image file or any kind of external file here. So, before start styling our page we don't have to write css inline in our html template.
- We will create a external folder that's going to handle all the static files. So, Django has a way for configuring that for us. So, we're just going to run through that.
- And what we are going to do in this video is first connect our stylesheet, adding a logo in the navbar and finish up by adding another field into our project model, so we can actually see a picture that goes with project.
- To do that, we first need to create a seprate directory at the root project area. So, we create a folder and name it `static`. So, inside of `static`, let's go ahead and create a file for styling. Within that we will have different folders for `css`, `js` and `images`.
- So, this is how our folder structure  should look like:

  ![](/imgs/Screenshot%202023-04-08%20at%203.07.56%20AM.png)

- Inside of the styles folder, and creare a stylesheet. Let's call this `main.css`
- For now, let's keep it simple by putting in some simple css, so:

  `main.css` - `static`

  ```CSS
  h1{
    color: purple;
  }
  ```

- So, the first stpe here is go into the `settings.py` and configure the static files. Go, to the botttom of the file where, we see `STATIC_URL`, underneath that create a new folder called `STATICFILES_DIRS` which will be a list and do as shown below:

  `settings.py`
  
  ```python
  STATIC_URL = "/static/"

  STATICFILES_DIRS = [
      os.path.join(BASE_DIR,"static") # This is a older way of including in files.
      # There's a new way, where we can directly include it as:
      # BASE_DIR / "static"
  ]
  ```

- After this django knows about this static folder. So, now to actually apply a static file in our template, we will go to `main.html`. So, first all we need to link the css to the html and than we need to changes the `href`. After that, it won't work unill we have loaded the static folder into the template. And we make the following changes:

  `main.html`

  ```jinja
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    {% load static %}
    {# The above line loads the files in "static" folder on the template. #}
    <html>

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href='{% static "css/main.css" %}'>
        {# In this way we can import a css file into django template as mentioned. #}

        <title>DevSearch - Connect with Developers!</title>

    </head>

    <body>
        {% include 'navbar.html' %}

        <hr>


        {% block content %}

        {% endblock content %}
        <hr>
        <p>FOOTER</p>
    </body>
    <script src="{% static 'uikit/app.js' %}"></script>
    <script src="{% static 'js/main.js' %}"></script>

    </html>  
  ```

  Also, we did a minor change in our existing template `projects.html` as we have nothing related to `h1` tag we got to add something in there.

  `projects.html` - `/templates/projects`

  ```Jinja
    {% extends 'main.html' %}

    {% block content %}

    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <ul>
        <table style="border: 1px solid white;border-collapse: collapse;">
            <tr>
                <th>Project Title</th>
                <th>Date Created</th>
                <th>Edit</th>
                <th>Delete</th>
            </tr>
            {% for project in projects %}
            <tr>
                <td><a href={% url 'project' project.id %}>{{ project.title }}</a></td>
                <td>{{ project.created }}</td>
                {# In the line above we are saying that this is a link to /project and a specified project id. #}
                <td><a href="{% url 'update-project' project.id %}">üìù</td>
                <td><a href="{% url 'delete-project' project.id %}">üóëÔ∏è</td>
            </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        </table>
    </ul>

    {% endblock content %}  
  ```

  And this is how the output would look like and the CSS has been implemented as mentioned:

  ![](/imgs/Screenshot%202023-04-08%20at%205.54.50%20AM.png)

- Now, we are gonna put the logo up on the website. So, get our logo from somewhere first of all. So, inside the `static` folder in `images`, we have our logo. So, we need to make following changes to the `navbar.html` template:

  ```Jinja
  {% load static %}

  <!-- Header Section -->
  <header class="header">
      <div class="container container--narrow">
          <nav class="header__nav">
              <img class="logo" src = "{% static "images/logo.svg" %}"/>
              <a href="{% url 'create-project' %}">Add Projects</a>
          </nav>
      </div>
  </header>
  ```

  And now, when you refresh the page, the logo is there in the navbar.

- Now adding images for the project is going to be the tough part actually, and is not so simple as it might appear cause the project is a seprate model in the datbase. So, for this we need to go to `models.py` file of the `projects` app, and add it as a attribute of the `Project` model. And the the new updated `model` for projects would look something like this:

  `models.py` - `projects` app(Updated Project model)

  ```python
  class Project(models.Model):
      title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
      description = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
      featured_image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True,default="default.jpg")
      # Setting the null=true means that it's not nessecary to have a description, it's an optional thing.
      # null by default is always set to false.
      # blank=True again means this field can be empty.
      demo_link = models.CharField(max_length=2000, null=True, blank=True)
      source_link = models.CharField(max_length=2000, null=True, blank=True)
      tags = models.ManyToManyField('Tag', blank=True)
      vote_total = models.IntegerField(default=0,null=True,blank=True)
      vote_ratio = models.IntegerField(default=0,null=True,blank=True)
      created =  models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
      id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, unique=True, primary_key=True, editable=False)

      def __str__(self):
          return self.title
  ```

  But, now when we save it back again, we get some error. Basically working with images in django requires a python library called `Pillow`, which needs to be installed. So, now close your live server and install the library using th command:

  ```bash
  pip3 install Pillow
  ```

  But, now also we will get error because we need to make the migrations so, that the column becomes a part of the database. So, we use the command `python3 manage.py makemigrations` to create migrations and than run the command `python3 manage.py migrate`. This will add the field to the table now, and all the errors are resolved now and we are good to go. But, now there's a small issue that is unreported that still needs to be resolved. So, right now if we upload the image from the admin panel, it is saved in the root directory of the project, and that is something which will disturb the file structure of the project. So, we need to configure it, so we need to go to `settings.py` and make the following changes:

  `settings.py`

  ```python
  MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,"static/images")
  # Add the above line just below STATICFILES_DIRS
  ```

  `MEDIA_ROOT` here tells django where to store the media related things when added to the page. And save it. Now, if you add the image for any of the project, that will be added directly to the `/static/images`.

  But, even after that we still can't access the image from the browser and will give an error. This is happening because useruploaded content is really it's own thing. So, we have to do some more changes to `settings.py`
  again. The changes are as follows:

  `settings.py`

  ```python
  #This the change that we need to do

  STATIC_URL = "/static/"
  MEDIA_URL = "/images/"

  STATICFILES_DIRS = [
      BASE_DIR / 'static'
  ]

  MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,"static/images")
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,"staticfiles")

  # Default primary key field type
  # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#default-auto-field

  DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"
  ```

  So, things don't simply end here. In the `urls.py` for the project, we need to add the url path to the `urls.py`. The changes to the file is as follows:

  `urls.py`

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path, include

  from django.conf import settings
  from django.conf.urls.static import static


  urlpatterns = [
      path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
      path("",include("projects.urls")), 
      # Here we are importing the paths from the projects app that we created, there in we have a file urls.py which has the urls to the views.
  ]

  urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
  ```

  We want to have access to the `settings.py` file over here, because we have to connect to our media route and media url. We are importing static, which help us create urls for our static. `MEDIA_ROOT` is where we send the user uploaded content and we just created a file. So, django actually didn't knew previously how to set that. So, now it's time when we finally make change to the template.

  `single-project.html` - `/templates/projects`

  ```Jinja
  {% extends 'main.html' %}

  {% block content %}
  <img style="width:100%" src = "{{ project.featured_image.url }}"/>
  <h2>{{ project.title }}</h2>
  <hr>
  {% for tag in tags %}
  <span style="border:1px solid grey">{{tag}}</span>
  {% endfor %}
  <br>
  <p>{{ project.description }}</p>

  {% endblock content %}
  ```

  And this is what it looks like:

  ![](/imgs/Screenshot%202023-04-10%20at%2012.13.57%20PM.png)

  Now, when we have done all the required changes we can see the images for each individual project. The next thing we have to do now here is add a input for the image in the form section. For that we need to make changes to the `forms.py` within the `projets` app.

  `forms.py` - `projects` app

  ```python
  from django.forms import ModelForm
  from .models import Project

  # Specifying ModelForm within the argument of the class, specifies that the given class is a Form.

  class ProjectForm(ModelForm):
      class Meta:
          model = Project
          fields = ["title","description","featured_image","demo_link","source_link","tags"]
  ```

- So, the field is here, but the form will still not process this image yet. In order to make it process, what we need   to do is tell this form to actually submit some form data here or submit some files. So, we need to set `enctype="multipart/form-data"` as follows:

  `project_form.html` - `/templates/projects` - `projects` app

  ```python
  {% extends 'main.html' %}
  {% block content %}

  <form action="" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      {% csrf_token %}
      {{ form.as_p }}
      <input type="submit">
  </form>

  {% endblock %}
  ```

  So, now this form can actually submit that data along with file previously it can't because if we don't have this, and we send it, it's just going to send the orignal fields in that form, But it's not gonna send the files.

  Now, we need to make some small changes in the `views.py` in the `projects` app, in order to get the files processed. We must tell that the `POST` Request that it gets, also contains a file. So, in `views.py` we need to change both `createProject` and `updateProject` as follows:

  `views.py` - `projects` app

  ```python
  # Updated createProject and updateProject

  def createProject(request):
    form = ProjectForm
    
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = ProjectForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            print(request.POST)
            return redirect("projects")

    context = {'form':form}
    return render(request, "projects/project_form.html", context)

  def updateProject(request,pk):
      project = Project.objects.get(id=pk)
      form = ProjectForm(instance=project)
      # We are calling a instance of form that is prefilled with the instance of the project we want to edit
      
      if request.method == "POST":
          form = ProjectForm(request.POST,request.FILES,instance=project)
          if form.is_valid():
              form.save()
              print(request.POST)
              return redirect("projects")

      context = {'form':form}
      return render(request, "projects/project_form.html", context)
  ```

  So, now if we edit any existing project or add a new project, the image is being processed accordingly.

## Static Files in Production

- So, django typically is not built for serving static files in production. Right now, it's in development, but once we put htis on our server, we need another way of hosting these. So, there's a thrid party library called `Django White Noise`, and this is something we will be using to host static files and then user uploaded content, we are gonna use something like AWS S3 Buckets, but we wanna seprate our static files from our django project.

- So, when we want to put something up for production, we will have to set `DEBUG = FALSE` in `settings.py` for the project, whcih will mean our static files will no longer work anymore.

- What we need to do here is, we are going to need something called `STATIC_ROOT` that we have already set before. `STATIC_ROOT` is kinda like `MEDIA_ROOT` where media defines where user uploaded content is going to go. `STATIC_ROOT` is basically gonna define where our static files in production are going to be.

  We can create the `staticfiles` folder manually, but we don't need to do it. There's a command called `collectstatic` that will do it for us. So, what `collectstatic` is gonna do is take all the files in the `static` along with the subolders and other files in it and it's gonna bundle them up into one file and than django can take care of that from there. So, go ahead and save it.

  ![](/imgs/Screenshot%202023-04-11%20at%2012.53.34%20AM.png)

  So, if we open the terminal and run the command `python3 manage.py collectstatic`, it's gonna bundle up those files and it's gonna create the folder with name `staticfiles` for us and throw all our static files in there. So, let's go ahead and run that. When we ran it, the file with the specified name got created. So, here we can see all the static for the admin panel. So, it basically just duplicated all of these files here.

  ![](/imgs/Screenshot%202023-04-11%20at%2012.54.42%20AM.png)

  So, now our static files are bundled up and we still need a third party package to actually display these. But before that we need to make changes to `urls.py` for the project.

  `urls.py`

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path, include

  from django.conf import settings
  # üëÜüèª we want to have access to the setting.py file over here, because we have to connect to our media route and media url.
  from django.conf.urls.static import static
  # üëÜüèª So, we are importing static, which help us create urls for our static


  urlpatterns = [
      path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
      path("",include("projects.urls")), 
      # Here we are importing the paths from the projects app that we created, there in we have a file urls.py which has the urls to the views.
  ]

  urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
  urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
  ```

  So, that;s our file path, but that's not all we have to do. Django still doesn;t know how to serve this up. Also, we need to update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py` as follows:

  `settings.py`
  
  ```python
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost','127.0.0.1']
  ```

  After, all these changes django is now looking into my static files intead of static folder here. And now we need to install a django thrid party package called `whitenoise`, using the command `pip3 install whitenoise` and add to the `MIDDLEWARE` as follows:

  `settings.py`

  ```python
  MIDDLEWARE = [
    "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
    "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
    "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
    "django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware",
    "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
    "django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware",
    "django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware",
    "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware", # Added by user.
  ]
  ```
  And that's all done, if you want to see things in Production mode, don't forget to set `DEBUG = False`.

</p>
</storng>
