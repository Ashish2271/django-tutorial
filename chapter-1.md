# Getting started with Django

![](imgs/1*Y0l-VVKTsvhv5zmSmTRJTQ.gif)

- Django is a python based Web-framework and it is a backend framework.
- THis means we can use python to build websites.
- It is more of a heavy weight framework. So, it uses a batteries included approach. That means it really is more opinionated in how you build out your application.
- It uses MVC(Model View Controller) design pattern for Django, it's model view template.
- Building API's with Django is easy. If we want to build a mobile App or use some kind of frontend framework, weneed some API data.
- Django makes it very easy, Django has something called The REST API Framework which is built on top of Django and The REST Framework helps you build REST APIs.
- Django follows the MVT structure, There's a model view control structure, which a lot of us from other frameworks may be familiar with.
- Django takes care of the controller aspect of things.

## MVT (Model View Template) Design Pattern

- The Mode is the Data Access Layer, this going to be our database tables built out in classes.
- Templates is the presentation layer . This is what the user will see.
- The View is the business logic.
- So, for wxample when we go to a certain website they are going to go through some of the URLs, we're gonna find the URLs that matches some kind of function in the backend and that's going to be our views.
- Those Views right there in the views layer that's gonna go ahead and get some data probably from the models and it's going to render some kind of template to us and we send that back to the user, that's the flow here.
- We're requesting data, the views, the business logic, and we just get this and send it back to the user. So, that's about MVTdesign pattern which is very much similar to MVC

            B[[URLs]] --> A[[Website]]
            B[[URLs]] -- HTTP Response --> C[[Views]]
            C[[Views]] -- HTTP Request --> B[[URLs]]
            C[[Views]] -..-> D[[Models]]
            D[[Models]] -..-> C[[Views]]
            C[[Views]] -..-> E[[Templates]]
            E[[Templates]] -..-> C[[Views]]
    ```

## What is a framework??

- Web-framework is simply a collection of modules, packages and libraries designed to speed-up development.
- Django already reconfigures a lot of things for us. It is strongly recommended and advised against you hand coding absolutely everything by yourself.
- There are various other backend frameworks that are openly available which include <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/NodeJs-339933?style=plastic&logo=Node.Js&logoColor=white"/>, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-777BB4?style=plastic&logo=PHP&logoColor=white"/>, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Laravel-FF2D20?style=plastic&logo=Laravel&logoColor=white"/> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Express-000000?style=plastic&logo=Express&logoColor=white"/>.

- There are other Python Frameworks as well which include <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-000000?style=plastic&logo=Flask&logoColor=white"/>, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CherryPie-000000?style=plastic&logo=CherryPie&logoColor=white"/>, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Web2Py-8DD6F9?style=plastic&logo=WebPack&logoColor=black"/> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Pyramid-000000?style=plastic&logo=Pyramid&logoColor=white"/>

# Setting up the Environment

- Make sure you have python installed on your desktop. It would be great if you have the latest version installed.
- In Python, venv or virtalenv helps you handle different Python packages installation for multiple projects. It stands for virtual environment, that lets you create a separate/isolated Python installation, and install different packages on to that virtual installation. It is very handy and easy to use.
- Using venv, you can easily work with multiple projects with various dependencies on the same machine at the same time.
- To setup virtual environment or venv on Python, first you will need PIP. It is the widely used packet manager for Python.
- PIP comes bundled with Python installation.
- On a Mac, Homebrew makes it easier to install Python along with pip. Simply, ðŸ”¥fire up your terminal and enter the following command:

    ```bash
    >> brew install python
    ```

- If you already have Python installed on your machine, you can check the version using the following command on you terminal.

    ```bash
    >> python -V
    ```

## Creating Virtual Environment

- To create a Virtual Environement, first we need to install some libraries.

  - Move to the folder and run the command

    ```bash
    >> pip3 install virtualenv
    ```

    This will install the `virtualenv` library.

- To create a virtual environment, head to your project directory and run the command: `virtualenv venv`.
- Now, in order to activate this virtaulenv that we created just now use the command follwoing commands.

  ```bash
  >> env\scripts\activate #for Windows Users
  >> source venv/bin/activate #for Mac Users
  ```

- In order to deactivate, the virtualenv that we created use the following command.
  
  ```bash
  >> env\scripts\deactivate #for Windows Users
  >> deactivate #for Mac Users
  ```

- When we enter the command `django-admin`, we see a list of commands that we have access to now.
- We will be taking notes of some of the nessecary commands that we need.
  - `makemigrations`: This command basically preps our database for migrations.
  - `migrate`: executes those migration. `migrate` creates those database tables.
  - `runserver`: This turns on our server.
  - `startproject`: This is how we create a django project
  - `startapp`: This creates app.

- Now, in order to create your project switch to `virtualenv` and use the command `django-admin startproject project_name` this will create the project for you.

- In order to create a app, within your project use the command `python manage.py startapp app_name`.

## Starting Django Server

- So, first switch to the recent directory that is created by the name you specified.
- Now, run the command `python manage.py runserver`.
- And this will make the server running.

## File Structure and there Functioning

- So, the first file we will be talking about is `settings.py`.
  - This file is basically the main project configuration for entire Django Project.
  - This is where we configure any app that we add in our middleware.
  - This is where we configure our templates, set up our database and the connection.
  - It's basically like command line centre to your project and how your project knows how to work, what to include and so

- The second file we will talk about is `urls.py`.
  - It is basically the URL navigation for our entire application.
  - Here we determine what route users goto.
  - `urlpatterns` is actually a list, this is where we can figure out how a user navigates the website and what happens when thy go to these routes later on. These will be functions that get executed.

- Then, we have `wsgi.py`.
  - `WSGI` stands for `Web Server Gateway Interface`.
  - This is the server for django.

- Then, we have `sgi.py`.
  - `SGI` stands for `Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface`.
  - This is just another option.
  - Django does give async support now

## Django Apps

``` Mermaid
        flowchart TB
            A{{Website}} ==> B{{Groups App}} -.-> E[DB Models, URL Routing, Templates] --> H[Contains all Database Tables, URL Routing and business logic for groups portion of the website]
            A[[Website]] ==> C{{MarketPlace App}} -.-> F[DB Models, URL Routing, Templates] --> I[Contains all Database Tables, URL Routing and business logic for MarketPlace feature]
            A[[Website]] ==> D{{User App}} -.-> G[DB Models, URL Routing, Templates] --> J[Contains all Database Tables, URL Routing and business logic for user accounts]
```

- So, in our case the project that we created is the website here. Now, the actual functionality in the website sits inside our apps.
- The Website folder right here or the `test_project` is basically the configuration that's our settings, URLs and servers. And all of this will be inside an app.
- Typically, a project is made up of multiple apps. We don't need multiple apps but that's the best way to do things.
- So, let's understand this with an example.

  - Let's say `facebook.com` is a project and let's say we want to build out our user portion. This is where users can login. We store user data, anything that surrounds users. We want to create it's own app called users. So the user app will take care of all the database tables for a user are all routing templates. It contains all database tables, URL Routing's and Business Logic for User Accounts.

  - Facebook Marketplace, if you are familiar with that facebook has an option to buy and sell products in your local city or whatever . So, the marketplace would be into it's own app. So, anything to do with sales transactions, products would be seprated into it's own app.

  - Then we have groups like Facebook Groups. Facebook would typically put that into a group's app. So, that all these files are completely seprated. We don't have to do it but it keeps our code clean becuase ince your project gets to a certain size it can really get messy. So, we seprate everything into apps.
