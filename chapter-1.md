# Getting started with Django

![](imgs/1*Y0l-VVKTsvhv5zmSmTRJTQ.gif)

- Django is a python based Web-framework and it is a backend framework.
- THis means we can use python to build websites.
- It is more of a heavy weight framework. So, it uses a batteries included approach. That means it really is more opinionated in how you build out your application.
- It uses MVC(Model View Controller) design pattern for Django, it's model view template.
- Building API's with Django is easy. If we want to build a mobile App or use some kind of frontend framework, weneed some API data.
- Django makes it very easy, Django has something called The REST API Framework which is built on top of Django and The REST Framework helps you build REST APIs.
- Django follows the MVT structure, There's a model view control structure, which a lot of us from other frameworks may be familiar with.
- Django takes care of the controller aspect of things.

## MVT (Model View Template) Design Pattern

- The Mode is the Data Access Layer, this going to be our database tables built out in classes.
- Templates is the presentation layer . This is what the user will see.
- The View is the business logic.
- So, for wxample when we go to a certain website they are going to go through some of the URLs, we're gonna find the URLs that matches some kind of function in the backend and that's going to be our views.
- Those Views right there in the views layer that's gonna go ahead and get some data probably from the models and it's going to render some kind of template to us and we send that back to the user, that's the flow here.
- We're requesting data, the views, the business logic, and we just get this and send it back to the user. So, that's about MVTdesign pattern which is very much similar to MVC

            A[[Website]] --> B[[URLs]]
            B[[URLs]] --> A[[Website]]
            B[[URLs]] -- HTTP Response --> C[[Views]]
            C[[Views]] -- HTTP Request --> B[[URLs]]
            C[[Views]] -..-> D[[Models]]
            D[[Models]] -..-> C[[Views]]
            C[[Views]] -..-> E[[Templates]]
            E[[Templates]] -..-> C[[Views]]
    ```

## What is a framework??

- Web-framework is simply a collection of modules, packages and libraries designed to speed-up development.
- Django already reconfigures a lot of things for us. It is strongly recommended and advised against you hand coding absolutely everything by yourself.
- There are various other backend frameworks that are openly available which include <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/NodeJs-339933?style=plastic&logo=Node.Js&logoColor=white"/>, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-777BB4?style=plastic&logo=PHP&logoColor=white"/>, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Laravel-FF2D20?style=plastic&logo=Laravel&logoColor=white"/> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Express-000000?style=plastic&logo=Express&logoColor=white"/>.

- There are other Python Frameworks as well which include <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-000000?style=plastic&logo=Flask&logoColor=white"/>, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CherryPie-000000?style=plastic&logo=CherryPie&logoColor=white"/>, <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Web2Py-8DD6F9?style=plastic&logo=WebPack&logoColor=black"/> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Pyramid-000000?style=plastic&logo=Pyramid&logoColor=white"/>

# Setting up the Environment

- Make sure you have python installed on your desktop. It would be great if you have the latest version installed.
- In Python, venv or virtalenv helps you handle different Python packages installation for multiple projects. It stands for virtual environment, that lets you create a separate/isolated Python installation, and install different packages on to that virtual installation. It is very handy and easy to use.
- Using venv, you can easily work with multiple projects with various dependencies on the same machine at the same time.
- To setup virtual environment or venv on Python, first you will need PIP. It is the widely used packet manager for Python.
- PIP comes bundled with Python installation.
- On a Mac, Homebrew makes it easier to install Python along with pip. Simply, ðŸ”¥fire up your terminal and enter the following command:

    ```bash
    >> brew install python
    ```

- If you already have Python installed on your machine, you can check the version using the following command on you terminal.

    ```bash
    >> python -V
    ```

# Creating Virtual Environment

- To create a Virtual Environement, first we need to install some libraries.

  - Move to the folder and run the command

    ```bash
    >> pip3 install virtualenv
    ```

    This will install the `virtualenv` library.

- To create a virtual environment, head to your project directory and run the command: `virtualenv venv`.
- Now, in order to activate this virtaulenv that we created just now use the command follwoing commands.

  ```bash
  >> env\scripts\activate #for Windows Users
  >> source venv/bin/activate #for Mac Users
  ```

- In order to deactivate, the virtualenv that we created use the following command.
  
  ```bash
  >> env\scripts\deactivate #for Windows Users
  >> deactivate #for Mac Users
  ```

- When we enter the command `django-admin`, we see a list of commands that we have access to now.
- We will be taking notes of some of the nessecary commands that we need.
  - `makemigrations`: This command basically preps our database for migrations.
  - `migrate`: executes those migration. `migrate` creates those database tables.
  - `runserver`: This turns on our server.
  - `startproject`: This is how we create a django project
  - `startapp`: This creates app.

- Now, in order to create your project switch to `virtualenv` and use the command `django-admin startproject project_name` this will create the project for you.
